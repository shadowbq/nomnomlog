nomnomlog tails one or more log files and sends syslog messages to a
remote central syslog server. It generates packets itself, ignoring the system
syslog daemon, so its configuration doesn't affect system-wide logging.

Use Benefits:

* Cross platform, os service ready, multi-architecture single solution
* Collecting logs from servers & daemons which don't natively support syslog
* Filtering for or eliminating specific log messages and / or files using regular expressions.
* When reconfiguring the system logger is less convenient than a purpose-built daemon (e.g., automated app deployments)
* Aggregating files not generated by daemons (e.g., package manager logs)

## Nomnomlog

Nomnomlog is a feature enhanced fork of the go-lang `remote_syslog2`. Nomnomlog differences include: different filter criteria prior to sending
logs to the central server, man pages, enhanced developer support and testing, more chip architectures, IPC Signals, and general fixes.

## Installing

Prepackaged distributions are available on the [nomnomlog releases page][releases].

```shell
# For Debian/Ubuntu you might want the .deb package
sudo dpkg -i nomnomlog_0.1.0_amd64.deb
# For RHEL/Centos you might want the .rpm package
sudo rpm -i nomnomlog-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Precompiled binaries in tar/gz for generic Linux are also available.

Untar the package, copy the "nomnomlog" executable into your $PATH,
and then customize the included example_config.yml with the log file paths
to read and the host/port to log to.

Optionally, move and rename the configuration file to `/etc/nomnomlog-config.yml` so
that nomnomlog picks it up automatically. For example:

```shell
sudo cp ./nomnomlog /usr/local/bin
sudo cp example_config.yml /etc/nomnomlog-config.yml
sudo vi /etc/nomnomlog-config.yml
```

Configuration directives can also be specified as command-line arguments (below).

## Usage

```shell

```

## Example

Daemonize and collect messages from files listed in `./example_config.yml` as
well as the file `/var/log/mysqld.log`. Write PID to `/tmp/nomnomlog.pid`
and send to port `logs.papertrailapp.com:12345`:

    $> nomnomlog -c example_config.yml -p 12345 --pid-file=/tmp/nomnomlog.pid /var/log/mysqld.log

Stay attached to the terminal, look for and use `/etc/nomnomlog-config.yml` if it
exists, and send with facility local0 to `a.example.com:514`:

    $> nomnomlog -D -d a.example.com -f local0 /var/log/mysqld.log

## Auto-starting at boot

***`nomnomlog` will daemonize by default.***

Sample init files can be found [in the examples directory](examples/). You may be able to:

    $> cp examples/nomnomlog.init.d /etc/init.d/nomnomlog
    $> chmod 755 /etc/init.d/nomnomlog

And then ensure it's started at boot, either by using:

    $> sudo update-rc.d nomnomlog defaults

or by creating a link manually:

    $> sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/nomnomlog /etc/rc3.d/S30nomnomlog



With `systemd` it is also very simple with `init.d` defaults or drop in the `systemd.service` file :

```
admin@system1:/etc$ sudo service nomnomlog status
● nomnomlog.service - LSB: Start and Stop
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/nomnomlog; generated)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2019-01-14 19:49:25 EST; 4s ago

    Tasks: 9 (limit: 4663)
   CGroup: /system.slice/nomnomlog.service
           └─17037 nomnomlog -c /etc/nomnomlog-config.yml --pid-file=/var/run/nomnomlog.pid

```

Additional information about init files (`init.d`, `supervisor`, `systemd` and `upstart`) are
available [in the examples directory](examples/).

## Sending messages securely

If the receiving system supports sending syslog over TCP with TLS, you can
pass the `--tls` option when running `nomnomlog`:

`$> nomnomlog -D --tls -p 1234 /var/log/mysqld.log`

or add `protocol: tls` to your configuration file.

## Configuration

By default, nomnomlog looks for a configuration in `/etc/nomnomlog-config.yml`.

The archive comes with a [sample config](https://github.com/shadowbq/nomnomlog/blob/master/example_config.yml). Optionally:

`$> cp example_config.yml.example /etc/nomnomlog-config.yml`

`nomnomlog-config.yml` has filenames to log from (as an array) and hostname and port
to log to (as a hash). Wildcards are supported using * and standard shell
globbing. Filenames given on the command line are additive to those in
the config file.

Only 1 destination server is supported; the command-line argument wins.

```yml
files:
    - /var/log/httpd/access_log
    - /var/log/httpd/error_log
    - /var/log/mysqld.log
    - /var/run/mysqld/mysqld-slow.log
destination:
    host: logs.papertrailapp.com
    port: 12345
    protocol: tls
```

nomnomlog sends the name of the file without a path ("mysqld.log") as
the syslog tag (program name).

After changing the configuration file, restart `nomnomlog` using the
init script or by manually killing and restarting the process. For example:

`$> /etc/init.d/nomnomlog restart`

## Advanced Configuration (Optional)

Here's an [advanced config](https://github.com/shadowbq/nomnomlog/blob/master/examples/nomnomlog-config.example.advanced.yml) which uses all options.

### Override hostname

Provide `--hostname somehostname` or use the `hostname` configuration option:

```yml
    hostname: somehostname
```

### Detecting new files

nomnomlog automatically detects and activates new log files that match
its file specifiers. For example, `*.log` may be provided as a file specifier,
and nomnomlog will detect a `some.log` file created after it was started.

By default, globs are re-checked every 10 seconds. To check for new files more
frequently, use the `--new-file-check-interval` argument. For example, to
recheck globs every 1 second, use:

    --new-file-check-interval 1

Note: messages may be written to new files in the period between when the
file is created and when the periodic glob check detects it. This data is not
transmitted.

If globs are specified on the command-line, enclose each one in single-quotes
(`'*.log'`) so the shell passes the raw glob string to nomnomlog (rather
than the current set of matches). This is not necessary for globs defined in
the config file.

### Log rotation and the behavior of nomnomlog

External log rotation scripts often move or remove an existing log file
and replace it with a new one (at a new inode). The Linux standard script
[logrotate](http://iain.cx/src/logrotate/) supports a `copytruncate` config
option.  With that option, `logrotate` will copy files, operate on the copies,
and truncate the original so that the inode remains the same.

`nomnomlog` will handle both approaches seamlessly, so it should be no
concern as to which method is used. If a log file is moved or renamed,
and a new file is created (at a new inode), `nomnomlog` will follow that
new file at the new inode (assuming it has the same absolute path name). If
a file is copied then truncated, `nomnomlog` will seek to the beginning of
the truncated file and continue to read it.

#### Log rotation edge cases to be aware of

Some logging programs such as Java's gclog (`-XX:+PrintGC` or `-verbose:gc`)
do not log in append mode, so if another program such as `logrotate` (set to
`copytruncate`) truncates the file, on the next write of the Java logger, the
OS will fill the file with NUL bytes up to the current offset of the file descriptor.
More info on that [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8353401/garbage-collector-log-loggc-file-rotation-with-logrotate-does-not-work-properl).
`nomnomlog` will detect those leading NUL bytes, discard them, and log the discard count.

### Excluding files from being sent

Provide one or more regular expressions to prevent certain files from being
matched.

```yml
exclude_files:
    - \.\d$
    - .bz2
    - .gz
```
### Line pattern matching 

`nomnomlog` includes logic to have both inclusion and exclusion patterns for syslog forwarding. 

#### Order of Operations for Regular Expression line Pattern matching

Filter order to collect and send line data is:

`If line matches ((include_patterns and does not match exclude patterns) or does not match exclude_patterns) then send line.`


#### Including lines matching a pattern

There may be certain times when you only want certain log messages to be sent.  These may be
Alert level log lines that are mixed into a TRACE level log. You can filter out all other lines
easily from the respective application.  To filter these lines, use the
include_patterns with an array or regexes:

```yml
    include_patterns:
     - include this
     - alert
```

#### Excluding lines matching a pattern

There may be certain log messages that you do not want to be sent.  These may be
repetitive log lines that are "noise" that you might not be able to filter out
easily from the respective application.  To filter these lines, use the
exclude_patterns with an array or regexes:

```yml
    exclude_patterns:
     - exclude this
     - \d+ things
```


### Multiple instances

Run multiple instances to specify unique syslog hostnames.

To do that, provide an alternate PID path as a command-line option to the
additional instance(s). For example:

    --pid-file=/var/run/nomnomlog_2.pid

Note: Daemonized programs use PID files to identify whether the program is already
running ([more](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12815/what-are-pid-and-lock-files-for/12818#12818)). Like other daemons, nomnomlog will refuse to run as a
daemon (the default mode) when a PID file is present. If a .pid file is
present but the daemon is not actually running, remove the PID file.

### Choosing app name

nomnomlog uses the log file name (like "access_log") as the syslog
program name, or what the syslog RFCs call the "tag." This is ideal unless
nomnomlog watches many files that have the same name.

In that case, tell nomnomlog to set another program name using the
`tag` attribute in the configuration file:

```yaml
files:
  - path: /var/log/httpd/access_log
    tag: apache
destination:
  host: logs.papertrailapp.com
  port: 12345
  protocol: tls
```

... or on the command line:

```shell
$> nomnomlog apache=/var/log/httpd/access_log
```

This functionality was introduced in version 0.17

## Handling SIGNALS

Linux signals can be caught and handled by the daemon. As an example SIGHUP will dump the current running configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Generate debug log

To output debugging events with maximum verbosity, run:

```shell
$> nomnomlog --debug-log-cfg=logfile.txt --log="<root>=DEBUG"
```

.. as well as any other arguments which are used in normal operation. This
will set [loggo](https://github.com/juju/loggo#func-parseconfigurationstring)'s
root logger to the `DEBUG` level and output to `logfile.txt`.

To manage it on the command line use:

```shell
./build/nomnomlog/nomnomlog -D -c /etc/nomnomlog-config.yml --log="<root>=Trace"
2018-12-17 17:55:31 INFO  nomnomlog.go:50 Connecting to 127.0.0.1:5514 over udp
2018-12-17 17:55:31 DEBUG  nomnomlog.go:183 Evaluating globs every 10s
2018-12-17 17:55:31 DEBUG  nomnomlog.go:199 Evaluating file globs
2018-12-17 17:55:31 INFO  nomnomlog.go:218 Forwarding file: /var/log/syslog
2018-12-17 17:55:31 TRACE  worker_registry.go:40 Adding /var/log/syslog to worker registry
2018-12-17 17:55:41 DEBUG  nomnomlog.go:199 Evaluating file globs
```

### Truncated messages

To send messages longer than 1024 characters, use TCP (either TLS or cleartext
TCP) instead of UDP. See "[Sending messages securely](#sending-messages-securely)" to
use TCP with TLS for messages of any length.

[Here's why](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/troubleshooting-remote-syslog-reachability/#message-length) longer UDP messages are impossible to send over the Internet.

### inotify

When running nomnomlog in the foreground using the `-D` switch, if you
receive the error:

    Error creating fsnotify watcher: inotify_init: too many open files

determine the maximum number of inotify instances that can be created using:

    $> cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances

and then increase this limit using:

    $> echo VALUE >> /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances

where VALUE is greater than the present setting. Confirm that nomnomlog starts
up and then apply this new value permanently by adding the following to
`/etc/sysctl.conf:`:

    fs.inotify.max_user_instances = VALUE

### "No space left on device"

When monitoring a large number of files, this error may occur:

    FATAL -- Error watching /path/here : no space left on device

To solve this, determine the maximum number of user watches that can be
created using:

    $> cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

and then increase them using:

    $> echo VALUE >> /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

Once again, confirm that nomnomlog starts and then apply this value permanently by adding the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf:`:

    fs.inotify.max_user_watches = VALUE

## Development

A local release build which is golang based is very easy to build and does not require
many external dependencies.

A distro-release is wrapped in a `rpm` or `deb` requires additional tooling that may not be necessary for individual usage.

The current convention is to use genus.species of ants for release names (Tetramorium.insolens).

### Dependencies for local-release

nomnomlog is written in go, and uses [govendor] to manage
dependencies. To get everything set up, [install go][goinstall] then
run:

```shell
$> go get github.com/kardianos/govendor
$> go get github.com/mitchellh/gox
$> go get github.com/shadowbq/nomnomlog
```

### Dependencies for distro-release

Distro Release building requirements are checked in the `Makefile`

    $> go get github.com/giantswarm/semver-bump

Distro builds may also include:

* ruby gem fpm (gem install -y fpm)
* rpmbuild (apt install -y rpm)
* etc..

OSX for OSX build.

```shell
$> make
Product Version 0.1.0
Checking Dependencies ---->
[..sic..]
fpm is not installed. See https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
```

### Building the release

Change the version in the VERSION file:

    $> semver-bump minor-release

Build a local-release

```shell
$> ./build.sh
Building nomnomlog 0.1.0 local-release, use Makefile for distro-releases.

$> ./build/nomnomlog/nomnomlog --version
nomnomlog 0.1.0
```

Build the distro-release

    $> make

### Test in Travis or CLI

    $> make test

To run tests manually:

```shell
# run all tests
$> go test ./...
# run all tests except the slower syslog reconnection tests
$> go test -short ./...
```

### Pipeline CI Releases

Travis-ci.org will push to github.com our successful builds when tagged with "v*"

From the CLI, add, commit, push to master. Then tag (annotate), and push the tag. This will cause a release cycle for travis to push the build files (deb,rpm,etc.) to repo release pages.

```shell
$> git add .
$> git commit -m 'updated to v1.0'
[master ba27ddc] updated to v1.0
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

$> git push origin master
...

To https://github.com/shadowbq/nomnomlog
   f747451..ba27ddc  master -> master

$> git tag -a 'v1.0' -m 'major version release'
$> git push origin tag v1.0
...
Counting objects: 9, done.

To https://github.com/shadowbq/nomnomlog
 * [new tag]         v1.0 -> v1.0
```

At the bottom of the Travis log you should see

```text
Preparing deploy
Logged in as shadowbq
Deploying to repo: shadowbq/nomnomlog
Current tag is: v1.0

Deploying application
Setting target_commitish to ba27ddc24d03a7e706f7af4a32a0b0773fdc018e

```

### Other Targets

```shell
$> make
        build
        clean
        depend
        package
        reportVersion
        tarball
        test
        darwin/
        linux/
        windows/
```

### ARM support

Current ARM builds support all ARM platforms with hardware floating point instruction sets. This
includes All Raspberry PI devices, most ARMv6 chips (Cortex), and ARMv7 and beyond.
